# HIERACHICAL-CLUSTERING
project title:analysi and prediction of 'small customers.csv' file of American mall market called as Phonix mall, find out on the basis of client requirements of dendograms of using scipy library with the help of 'scipy.cluster.hierachy' to ace the no:of linkages as a clustering to predict.

#problem Statement: The American Finance market clients as per the rate of gdp of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their bussiness market 
## As a Data Science Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkages in upcoming features  
##TASK1-With the help of scipy library import the libraries and import the dataset 
##TASK 2:Using the dendograms tof find the optimal number of clusters 
##TASK3:Create a hierachy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplotlib
